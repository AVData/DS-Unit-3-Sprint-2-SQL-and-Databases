# Answers for Module 3 Assignment


## Describe two situations where:
- Relational database is appropriate:
    Where multiple datasets (as tables) are being utilized; one example is
    data in the DMV, where different tables contain different information
    regarding individuals, but that information is all related in some form or
    fashion.

    Situation 1:
    I am working on image data generated by autonomous vehicles on the road.  My
    goal with this data is to answer questions regarding climate, road, geographic,
    and vehicle conditions on any given day where an autonomous vehicle was
    involved in a traffic accident.

    Considering the different datasets being used, the best DBMS to use here is
    relational.  The relational DBMS should allow us to query the image data to
    answer specific questions regarding the all of the other conditions pertinent
    to the traffic accident; and will allow us to incorporate new data if and or
    as necessary.

- Non-relational database is appropriate:
    Where data is contained as documents, and the data do not require the use
    of translational keys; which are used in relational databases to connect
    data tables.  These type of data-stores allow for 'all information for a
    given object' to live in a single instance within the database.

    Situation 2:


- MapReduce:
    -

terminal command:
`mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster0-ji4lx.mongodb.net/test"  --username Avargas`

helpful link to use mongo:
https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/insert-data-into-your-cluster/#moving-forward


Used the following command in the terminal to connect to the MongoDB Shell
`mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster0-ji4lx.mongodb.net/test"  --username Avargas`

Should result in an enter password request; insert password from the
MongoDB user tab.  You might need to update the user password in the user profile
password =

The MongoDB shell on terminal is different from using the python shell; in the
MongoDB shell the equivalent of:

client = pymongo.MongoClient(
    "mongodb+srv://admin:HfAXLeBx3nWPkKwV@cluster0-hvfwb.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority")
db = client.test

Is simply running:
`mongo "mongodb+srv://cluster0-ji4lx.mongodb.net/test"  --username Avargas`

which should connect you to the mongodb shell.

Once in the MongoDB shell you can begin with the following commands:

`db.help()`

Which will provide you help with the db methods available through the shell

Running our first method call on the db.test:
run the following code in the terminal and it should allow you to create a new "collection"

`db.test.insertOne({'x': 1})``

running `show collections` should provide us with the db test created

Run the following dictionaries

`loris_doc = {
    'favorite_animal': 'peacock',
    'favorite_color': 'blue',
    'favorite_number': 7
}

jons_doc = {
    'favorite_animal': 'narwhal',
    'favorite_color': 'blue',
    'favorite_number': 24
}

emmas_doc={
    'favorite_animal':'panther',
    'favorite_color': 'purple',
    'favorite_number': 2
}

rays_doc = {
    'favorite_animal': 'wolf',
    'favorite_color': 'blue',
    'favorite_number': 16
}

baisali_doc={
    'favorite_animal':'elephant',
    'favorite_color': 'red',
    'favorite_number': 2
}

juds_doc = {
    'favorite_animal': 'liger',
    'favorite_color': 'blellow',
    'favorite_number': 42,
    'favorite_direction': 'Weast'
}

jans_doc = {
    'favorite_city': 'rotterdam',
    'favorite_color': 'green',
    'favorite_sport': 'football'
}

faraazs_doc = {
    'favorite_animal': 'ring-tailed lemur',
    'favorite_color': 'forest green',
    'favorite_restaurant': 'in-n-out'
}`

Then run the following list

`all_docs = [loris_doc, jons_doc, emmas_doc, rays_doc, baisali_doc, juds_doc,
            jans_doc, faraazs_doc]`

and then insert the list 'all_docs' into your database with the
`.insertMany()` method

with the `.find()` method you can see what is in the db
